PDR: CLAWDBOT Gateway Dashboard (White / Red / Edgy)
Target: Replit-hosted web app. Single-page, client-heavy, minimal backend. This is a product design + engineering brief, not marketing copy.

1. Product Intent

Build a command-center dashboard for agent orchestration that feels sharp, adversarial, and technical. Visual tone: clean white canvas, surgical red highlights, compressed, slightly aggressive typography. This should feel closer to a Bloomberg terminal crossed with a red-team ops console than a SaaS admin panel.

Primary user: technical founder / operator supervising autonomous agents, cron jobs, and intervention channels.
Primary value: situational awareness + fast intervention.

2. Core UX Principles (Non-negotiable)

White-first background
No dark mode by default. Darkness is reserved for error states, incident mode, or focus overlays.

Red as semantic signal, not decoration
Red means one of:

system attention required

competitive pressure

agent deviation

high-signal insight

Edgy text through hierarchy, not gimmicks
Edge comes from:

tight leading

aggressive section labels

monospace for system facts

uppercase micro-labels

Latency-aware UI
Every async action shows:

pending

resolved

failed
No silent state transitions.

3. Information Architecture
Left Rail (Control Plane)

Persistent, narrow, icon-forward.

Logs

Behavior:

Icons only by default

Expand on hover

Active item gets red left-border + red dot

Top Bar (System Status)

Right-aligned, minimal.

Global Health Indicator
● OK (green) | ● DEGRADED (amber) | ● INCIDENT (red)

Active Gateway Selector
Dropdown. Monospace. Red caret.

Hard Refresh / Re-sync Icon
Explicitly visible. No auto-magic assumption.

Main Panel: Chat / Briefing Surface

This is not a “chat app”. It is a live operational log with conversational override.

Section Blocks (Stacked Vertically)

MORNING / CURRENT BRIEF

Time-stamped

System-generated

Weather, infra notes, external context hooks

Red underline on date

COMPETITOR SCAN

Title in uppercase, tight tracking

Bullet density high

View counts, timestamps, velocity indicators

Red flame icon only when momentum > threshold

TRENDING SIGNALS

Media mentions

Platform shifts

Tool releases

Red used for “strategic implication” lines only

AGENT OUTPUT / OVERNIGHT WORK

Checkbox-confirmed tasks

Each task expandable

Failure auto-expands in red frame

DIRECT INTERVENTION INPUT

Chat input at bottom

Monospace

Explicit “Send” button

No auto-send on Enter unless toggled

4. Visual System
Colors

Background: #FFFFFF

Primary text: #0A0A0A

Secondary text: #4A4A4A

Borders: #E5E5E5

Accent Red: #C4001A

Error Red: #FF0033

Red usage rules:

Borders, underlines, indicators

Never full red backgrounds except incident mode

Typography

Headings: Inter or Space Grotesk, semi-bold

Body: Inter, regular

System/meta: JetBrains Mono or SF Mono

Text style cues:

Section headers: uppercase, small size, tight letter spacing

Metrics: monospace, darker weight

Alerts: red underline + bold, not larger font

5. Interaction Model

Hover reveals controls, never auto-acts

Click always confirms intent visually

Red indicates importance, not clickability

Expand/collapse is cheap and fast, no animations over 150ms

6. Technical Architecture (Replit-Friendly)
Frontend

React + Vite

TailwindCSS with strict token usage

No component library abstractions

CSS variables for theme control

Backend (Lightweight)

Node.js

WebSocket for live updates

REST fallback for history

State

Local UI state: client-side

Session state: server

Logs append-only

Replit Notes

Use single repo

index.html + src/

WebSocket server runs in same Replit instance

No external auth initially; token header stubbed

7. Non-Goals (Explicitly Excluded)

No onboarding flows

No marketing copy

No gradients

No soft shadows

No “friendly” empty states

8. Success Criteria

User can identify system health in <1 second

Overnight agent work is auditable without scrolling fatigue

Red never feels noisy

Dashboard feels decisive, not polished

9. Optional Phase-2 Extensions

Incident Mode: flip to white-on-black + red dominance

Diff view for agent output changes

Inline “why” explanations for agent decisions

Competitor velocity sparklines
